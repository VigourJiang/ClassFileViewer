ClassFileViewer
===============

Parse java class file and show the content in a web page.

Most parser code comes from an open source project named Java-Class-Viewer, see http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/35915/Java-Class-Viewer.

Although Java-Class-Viewer only supports jdk < 1.5 , this project plans to support java 5/6/7/8. 
Currently it can parse annotation and generic related data.

Currently, I use SWT Browser, HTML and Javascript as the UI technology, as HTM5 is much more powerful and lighter than Swing/SWT.
