ClassFileViewer
===============

This project parses java class file and show the content in a web page. Most parser codes originate from [Java-Class-Viewer](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/35915/Java-Class-Viewer), which supports jdk versions up to 1.4. Since the development of Java-Class-Viewer has been stopped for years, I hope I can update it to parse the lattest version.

Currently it can parse annotation and generic related data.
